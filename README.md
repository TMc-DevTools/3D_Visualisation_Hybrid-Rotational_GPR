# 3D_Visualisation_Hybrid-Rotational_GPR
Data processing and visualisation workflow for analysis of gprMax simulation output &lt;.OUT/.HDF5>, planar GPR datasets from Radar Systems Inc. &lt;.SGY> files and new hybrid-rotational GPR output files from &lt;.S1P> Keysight VNA frequency sweep measurement files. 

## Programs: 
- (A) gprMax area scan batch scripting
- (B) Firmware for a Raspberry Pi 3 controlled hybrid-rotational GPR system for laboratory data collection.  
- (C) Modular 3D Visualisation workflow based on ETL architecture alongside joint Shimozaki-Shinomoto Isovalue and HDBSCAN proximal clustering method for feasture segmentation.
- (D) Combined Processing Methodology code for numerical implantation on 1D GPR trace data files, specifically <.S1P> format.
